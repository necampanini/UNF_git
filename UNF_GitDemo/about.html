                            The whole idea behind these code camps is to share knowledge. Yes, it can better prepare
                            students for their upcoming senior projects, but I signed on really to "pay it forward".
                            I value a willingness to share knowledge and experience. Thanks to those before me, I am able
                            to say I am better off now than I was before. This applies to all aspects of my life, and not
                            only professionally. I feel strongly about helping others, and I hope I can pass along some of
                            my knowledge and experience (however minor it might be) to those who come after me.

                            That aside, I jumped at the opportunity to do a presentation on Version Control (and by
                            extension: Git) because it's something I am constantly amazed by. I also feel I knew the basics
                            well enough to give a crash course in it. Really, there are more qualified people than I, and
                            there hundreds if not thousands of resources you can learn version control from. However, if
                            I impart some of the importance of this subject onto you students, I'd've done some measure of
                            good.

                            I also think it's important to point out the importance of <i>reading.</i> If you don't like
                            sitting down and focusing on reading and researching new concepts, you're going to have a bad time.
                            I am not going to make any assumptions about how much time students have available for research,
                            but use whatever time you do have, wisely and productively. This holds true at any stage in your
                            career.
